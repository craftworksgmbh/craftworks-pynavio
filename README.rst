Python lib for navio

* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------
* Pynavio.Client is a navio API client that enables users to upload models and data, deploy and retrain models etc.
* Pynavio.mlflow.to_navio function calls mlflow.pyfunc.save_model function, saving a model zip file as required by navio.
    * it enables inferring the conda environment (with pip requirements) and adding extra pip dependencies to the inferred environment
    * it enables adding sys dependencies to the navio model
    * it also validates the models with Pynavio.mlflow.ModelValidator by default
* Pynavio.mlflow.ModelValidator is a class that validates the model (prediction/example request/MLmodel metadata schema checks, warnings related nested types/big model sizes)
* Pynavio.infer_external_dependencies is a helper function that infers the external dependencies based on the file path. Please refer to its doc string for limitations.
* Pynavio.infer_imported_code_path is a helper function that infers the imported code paths based on the file path and the root path. Please refer to its doc string for limitations.
* Pynavio.make_example_request generates a request schema for a navio model from data.
